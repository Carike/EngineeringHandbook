# F5

A fun way to check if in issue is related to the F5: https://isitthef5.com/

F5's BIG-IP is a family of products covering software and hardware designed around application availability, access control, and security solutions.  That's right, the BIG-IP name is interchangeable between F5's software and hardware application delivery controller and security products.  This is different from BIG-IQ, a suite of management and orchestration tools, and F5 Silverline, F5's SaaS platform.  

When people refer to BIG-IP this can mean a single software module in BIG-IP's software family or it could mean a hardware chassis sitting in your data center.  This can sometimes cause a lot of confusion when people say they have questions about "BIG-IP" but we'll break it down here to reduce the confusion.

## Different componets

### BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM)

Central to F5's full traffic proxy functionality, LTM provides the platform for creating virtual servers, performance, service, protocol, authentication, and security profiles to define and shape your application traffic.  Most other modules in the BIG-IP family use  LTM as a foundation for enhanced services.

### BIG-IP Application Security Manager (ASM)

his is F5's web application firewall (WAF) solution.  Traditional firewalls and layer 3 protection don't understand the complexities of many web applications.  ASM allows you to tailor acceptable and expected application behaviour on a per-application basis.  Zero-day, DoS, and click fraud all rely on traditional security devices' inability to protect unique application needs; ASM fills the gap between traditional firewall and tailored granular application protection.
