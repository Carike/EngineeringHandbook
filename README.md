# Engineering Handbook

Document learnings and steps I would like to reference in the future

I wanted to create a place to store usefill tips and tricks I learn everyday. The problem is it is not always to easy to find it again when you most need it. 

- Quick references
- Not enough content for a blog post
- Usefull info not used often, but helpful when required

So in stead of creating a wiki like most of us use at work, I wanted to test out the document site generators available.

## Architecture

So to keep things simple, the handbook consists of the following:
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the site
* [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) to generate the site from Markdown
